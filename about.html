      <h3>Born in Cleveland, OH, I spent the majority of my
        childhood outside of the house in some form or fashion. A sports-obsessed
        kid by all measures, I loved (and still love) playing baseball, basketball,
        soccer, tennis, and golf. Music has also been an integral part of my life and
        I'm thankful that I've had the opportunity to study piano classically from an early age.
        Piano took me many cool new places, including NYC to play in Carnegie Hall's
        Weill Recital Hall.

      <h3>I started at Chagrin Falls High School in 2013, and was lucky enough to discover
        a couple of passions from the onset of my time there. After my first year on the school golf
        team, I knew I wanted to become more serious about the game. I began playing in more amateur
        tournaments, and found a love for competing while traveling the country with my dad. I'm hoping
        that this site can serve (among its other functions) as a worthy database for documenting all of
        the places and memories I have associated with golf over the years.

      <h3>I'm currently a sophomore at Duke University studying
        Computer Science and Finance. Duke has been an awesome experience, and it seems like every
        week I'm discovering new organizations, projects, and activities that I want to get involved
        with. After Duke, I hope to pursue a role in tech, finance, consulting, or some intersection
        of these fields.
