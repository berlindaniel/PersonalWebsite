      <h3>Born in Cleveland, OH, I spent the majority of my
        childhood outside of the house in some form or fashion. A sports-obsessed
        kid by all measures -- I loved (and still love) playing baseball, basketball,
        soccer, tennis, and golf -- I was always joining new teams and activities.
        Music has also been an integral part of my life
        and I'm thankful that I've had the opportunity to study classical piano from an
        early age. Piano took me to many cool new places, including New
        York, New York to play in Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall.

      <h3>I started at Chagrin Falls High School in 2013, and was lucky enough to discover
        a couple of passions from the onset. After my first year on the school golf team, I knew I wanted
        to become more serious about the game. I began playing in more amateur tournaments, and found a love
        for competing while traveling the country with my dad. I'm hoping that this site can serve (among its other functions)
        as a worthy database for documenting all of the places and memories I have associated with golf over the years.

      <h3>I'm currently a sophomore at Duke University studying
        Computer Science and Finance. Duke has been an awesome experience, and it seems that every
        week I'm finding something new and intriguing going on around here. My interests after school
        include tech, finance, and consulting -- a pretty broad umbrella that I hope to refine as my time here
        comes to a close!
